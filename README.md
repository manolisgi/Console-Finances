# Console-Finances

## Description 

In this repo I used my newfound JavaScript skills in order to create a code for analyzing the financial records of a company. This calculates the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
 
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Usage 

The code uses given data of an array with the company's profit/loss for every month.
